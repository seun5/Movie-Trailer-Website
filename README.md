# Movie-Trailer-Website
Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nano Degree Project #1

Using the Movie Database(tMDB) API, the script runs to collect API responses using movie IDs to save them in python class `Movie`. 

### Examples 

#### Enter new movie
Add into the document
```
movie.append(media.Movie("<movid_id>"))
```

#### Command Line
To get the program started to create an html page that lists my favorite movies run the command line on python
```
entertainment_center.py
```

### Issues
* When our movie title is longer than 1 line, it breaks the html formating as the container size gets too large.
