# Movie-Trailer-Website
Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nano Degree Project #1

Using the Movie Database(tMDB) API, the script runs to collect API responses using movie IDs to save them in python class `Movie`. 
After doing so, using a starter code from Udacity, we will extract the data into a webpage using _fresh_tomatoes.py_

## Examples 


#### Enter new movie


Add into the document
```
movie.append(media.Movie("<movie_id>"))
```

#### Command Line


To get the program started to create an html page that lists my favorite movies run the command line on python
```
entertainment_center.py
```


## Issues and Improvements

* When our movie title is longer than 1 line, it breaks the html formating as the container size gets too large.
* We can improve on the original template for the website.
