# Movie-Trailer-Website
Udacity Full Stack Web Developer Nano Degree Project #1

Using the Movie Database(tMDB) API, the script runs to collect API responses using movie IDs to save them in python class `Movie`. 
After doing so, using a starter code from Udacity, we will extract the data into a webpage using _fresh_tomatoes.py_

## Examples 


#### Enter new movie


Add into file _entertainment_center.py_ if you want to add new movies into the document
```
movie.append(media.Movie("<movie_id>"))
```

#### With the terminal:

* Clone the directory
* Navigate into the directory cd repository_name
* Run python entertainment_center.py

#### With IDLE:

* Open IDLE
* In the menu bar click on Run -> Run Module or press F5 on your keyboard


## Issues and Improvements

* When our movie title is longer than 1 line, it breaks the html formating as the container size gets too large
* We can improve on the original template for the website
